# Tabs/Windows Counter and Stats

This is a Chrome extension that keeps track of the number of tabs and windows opened and displays a chart of the data collected over the last few days.

This extension was developed in cooperation with OpenAI's ChatGPT (Mar 14, 2023 version) as an experiment to explore its capabilities and how well it works in tandem with a programmer who has little-to-no experience in developing browser extensions.
